        <p>Hey Babe,</p>
        <p>You are the most beautiful woman I know. Your smile—oh, that smile—it’s like the first light of dawn, soft and warm, chasing away every shadow in my heart. Your laughter is my favorite music, a song I never want to stop hearing. And your aura? It’s like standing in a field of flowers on a perfect spring day: calm, beautiful, and full of life. 🌸💕</p>
        <p>Every day with you feels like a new adventure. I’m so proud of the person you are—strong, kind, and full of dreams. You inspire me to be better, to love deeper, and to cherish every little moment. I want to spend forever with you, holding your hand, sharing your joys, and being your safe place when the world feels heavy. ❤️</p>
        <p>Happy Birthday Abisola, my beautiful queen. Here’s to us, to you, and to forever. 🥂💖</p>
        <p>I love you more than words can ever say. 💖 
	<p>- Ayo</p>
